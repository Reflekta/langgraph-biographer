# Sample Initial Interview Session

## Configuration Setup

```yaml
# Simple setup - just configure the two names
deceased_name: "Robert Chen"
interviewee_name: "Sarah Chen"
```

**How it works**: The AI automatically detects that both people share the "Chen" last name and intelligently infers they're likely family, then gently explores the specific relationship during the conversation.

## Sample Interview Conversation

**AI Interviewer**: Thank you so much for taking the time to help me learn about Robert Chen, Sarah. I can already tell he meant a great deal to you. I notice you both share the Chen name - I imagine you must be family. Could you tell me a bit about your relationship with Robert and what he was like?

**Sarah**: _takes a deep breath_ Oh wow, where do I even start? Dad was... he was this perfect mix of being incredibly gentle but also so determined. When I think of him, I immediately picture him in the kitchen on Sunday mornings, making these elaborate breakfasts for our whole family. He'd be humming - he was always humming some old Chinese song while he cooked.

**AI Interviewer**: That's such a beautiful image, Sarah. I can almost hear that humming. Tell me more about those Sunday morning breakfasts - what was that like for your family?

**Sarah**: They were magical, honestly. Dad would get up early - like 6 AM - and by the time the rest of us woke up, the whole house would smell like fresh pancakes or his famous congee. But it wasn't just the food, you know? He'd set the table with our good dishes, even though it was just a regular Sunday. Mom used to tease him about it, but he'd say "Every day with family is special enough for the good dishes."

**AI Interviewer**: "Every day with family is special enough for the good dishes" - that sounds like it really captured who your father was. Can you help me understand what family meant to Robert?

**Sarah**: _voice becomes softer_ Everything. Family was absolutely everything to him. You have to understand, he came here from China in 1985 with basically nothing. He left his parents, his siblings, everyone he knew. So when he had us - me and my brother Michael - we became his whole world. He used to say we were his "American dream come true," but not in the way you'd expect. It wasn't about money or success. It was about having a family to love.

**AI Interviewer**: That must have been quite a sacrifice for him, leaving everyone behind. How did he handle being so far from his family in China?

**Sarah**: _pauses, eyes getting a bit misty_ It was really hard for him, especially in the early years. He'd get these expensive international phone calls - this was before email and video calls, you know? - and afterwards he'd be quiet for hours. Mom told me once that he'd sometimes sit in his car after work just crying, missing his mom. But he never let us see that sadness. With us, he was always... present. Always making sure we knew we were loved.

**AI Interviewer**: I can see how much that meant to you, Sarah. It sounds like he carried a lot privately to protect his family. Were there ways you could tell when he was missing home?

**Sarah**: _small smile_ Yeah, actually. When Dad was feeling homesick, he'd cook. Not just Sunday breakfasts, but these elaborate Chinese dishes that took hours. He'd be in the kitchen till midnight making dumplings from scratch, or this soup his mother used to make. The kitchen would be a complete disaster, but the next day we'd have this incredible feast. It was like he was cooking his way back to his childhood, you know?

**AI Interviewer**: What a powerful way to connect with his memories. Did he ever share stories about his childhood in China while he was cooking?

**Sarah**: Oh my goodness, yes! That's when we got our best stories about Grandma and his life before America. He'd tell us about helping in his family's little restaurant, or about the time he and his brother caught fireflies in jars during summer nights. His whole face would light up. _laughs softly_ He'd always end with "But you two, you have opportunities I never dreamed of. That's why we're here."

**AI Interviewer**: It sounds like he found a beautiful way to honor his past while building a future for you and Michael. What were some of those opportunities he was most proud of you both achieving?

**Sarah**: _tears starting_ Oh gosh, everything. I mean, everything was a big deal to him. When I made honor roll in third grade, he laminated the certificate and hung it on the refrigerator. When Michael got into college - he was the first in our family to go to university - Dad cried at the dinner table. Happy tears, but still. And when I graduated med school... _voice breaks slightly_ he must have told every person at the grocery store that his daughter was going to be a doctor.

**AI Interviewer**: I can see how proud he was of you both. That must have meant so much. Sarah, take your time - these memories are precious.

**Sarah**: _wiping eyes_ Sorry, I thought I'd be better at this. It's just... he worked so hard for us to have choices he never had. He had two jobs for most of my childhood - days at the electronics factory, nights cleaning offices. But he never complained. Ever. He'd come home exhausted, and still help us with homework, still make time for our school events.

**AI Interviewer**: Don't apologize at all - your love for him is beautiful to witness. It sounds like your father's work ethic was incredible. Do you remember what drove him to work so hard?

**Sarah**: He had this saying: "I plant trees whose shade I'll never sit in." He always said that his job wasn't to be comfortable - it was to make sure his children could choose their own comfort. And he meant it. We lived pretty simply so he could save money for our education. I didn't realize until I was older that he was driving a 15-year-old car so I could take piano lessons.

**AI Interviewer**: "I plant trees whose shade I'll never sit in" - what a profound way to think about parenthood. It sounds like education was really important to Robert.

**Sarah**: _nodding emphatically_ So important. He didn't get to finish high school in China because his family needed him to work, so he was determined that wouldn't happen to us. But it wasn't just about grades or getting into good schools. He wanted us to love learning. He'd take us to the library every Saturday - it was like our family tradition. He'd sit there with his English textbooks while Michael and I picked out picture books.

**AI Interviewer**: He was learning alongside you two. That's incredible. What was it like watching your father learn English?

**Sarah**: _smiling through tears_ It was actually really inspiring. He was so patient with himself, so determined. He'd practice by reading our bedtime stories out loud to us, even when we were too old for them. Sometimes he'd stumble over words, and we'd help him, and he'd say "See? You're already teaching your old dad something." He made it feel like we were all learning together.

**AI Interviewer**: That sounds like such a gift - turning what could have been embarrassing into something that brought you closer together. Sarah, you've shared such beautiful memories. As we wrap up today, is there one story or moment that you feel really captures who your father was at his core?

**Sarah**: _long pause, thinking_ Actually, yes. When I was in high school, I was having a really hard time with this group of mean girls. I was miserable, coming home crying every day. And Dad - who never missed work, never - he took a day off to drive me to school. But instead of dropping me at the front door like usual, he parked the car and said, "Sarah, you walk in there like you belong, because you do. And if anyone makes you feel small, you remember that you are Robert Chen's daughter, and Robert Chen's daughter bows to no one."

_voice breaking with emotion_

That was who he was. He gave us this incredible sense of worth, of belonging. Not because of what we achieved, but because of whose we were. We were his, and that made us precious.

**AI Interviewer**: Sarah, what a beautiful way to honor your father's memory. That story captures such love and strength. Thank you for sharing these precious memories with me today. I can see how much Robert meant to you, and how much of his love and values live on in you.

Would you be comfortable meeting again soon? I'd love to hear more about Robert's journey to America, and maybe learn about some of his dreams and aspirations for the future.

**Sarah**: _wiping eyes, but smiling_ Yes, absolutely. This actually felt really good. It's nice to talk about the dad he was, not just... you know, how we lost him. There's so much more to share.

**AI Interviewer**: Perfect. Before we finish, is there anything about Robert that you want to make sure gets captured? Anything you're afraid people might not know about him?

**Sarah**: Just... that he was funny. We've talked about how hard-working and loving he was, but he was also genuinely hilarious. He had this dry sense of humor and would make these little jokes that would catch you off guard. I don't want people to think he was always serious just because he took life seriously, you know?

**AI Interviewer**: That's such an important distinction, Sarah. A man who could find humor while carrying such responsibility for his family's future. I'll make sure we explore that side of Robert in our next conversation. Thank you again for trusting me with these memories.
